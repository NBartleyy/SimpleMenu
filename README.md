# SimpleMenu
A very simple GUI menu to help you create a mod menu for Unity 3D games.

# Information
SimpleMenu is a very simple menu that will help you get started in making a mod menu for Unity 3D games. It will create a button, label, and other stuff that you can fully customize and add on to. The code is easy to understand if you have used Unity 3D and coded in C# before.

# Using The Menu
Please if you don't know how to fully use the menu don't email and complain to me! This menu is simple as I can get it to be and if you just started out and don't know the code then please do research and learn the language C# and make sure you have knowledge about Unity and have atleast used it before.

# Requirements
This code isn't a program but just some text. You will need to use Unity 3D or dnSpy to use the code. If you use Unity 3D then just create a new C# script and add the code into it.
