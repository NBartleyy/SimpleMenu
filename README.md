# SimpleMenu
A very simple GUI menu to help you create a mod menu for Unity 3D games.

# Information
SimpleMenu is a very simple menu that will help you get started in making a mod menu for Unity 3D games. It will create a button, label, and other stuff that you can fully customize and add on to. The code is easy to understand if you have used Unity 3D and coded in C# before.

# Using The Menu
Most Unity 3D games have a file that is usually named "Assembly-CSharp.dll" which has code in it that you can view using the dnSpy program. This code has every you would need to modify the game. You can find your player speed if it has it and even more using this simple DLL file. This DLL file is usually found in the Data > Managed folder. Once you can view what is in the DLL file then you go on from there to find a way to implement the menu. There are many videos online on how to make a Unity 3D mod menu and I suggest watching them. This code is only to create a menu with some buttons and other GUI things.

# Requirements
This code isn't a program but just some text. You will need to use Unity 3D or dnSpy to use the code. If you use Unity 3D then just create a new C# script and add the code into it.
